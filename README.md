# KinematicAC
Demo Implementation of Motion Matching into Adventure Creator with the help of the Kinematic Character Controller.

First things first. This small project is still in early alpha.

**Requirements:**
* Motion Matching
* Kinematic Character Controller
* Adventure Creator

Optional:
* Movement Animset Pro:  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/movement-animset-pro-14047

**Known Issues:**
* Face After Moving - Not working
* Walk to Marker - Not working on Player class in 3rd Person View as the camera movement influences the walking path
* Player constraint "Disable Movement" in Direct Movement - Not working
* Walking/Running doesn't work on keyboard or mouse (double click) inputs but on controllers (analog sticks)
* Footsteps system has to be run by MxM
